# üîç Current Integration Status

## What's Working ‚úÖ
1. **AgentVerse** - SRE ServiceNow Specialist agent exists and can chat
2. **ServiceNow MCP Server** - Running as a separate process (PID 48624)
3. **Coupling Created** - Connection established between agent and MCP server
4. **OpenAI Integration** - Agent uses GPT-4o-mini for conversations

## What's Missing ‚ùå
1. **MCP Tool Usage in Chat** - The agent doesn't actually call MCP tools during conversations
2. **Active Coupling** - The coupling exists but is marked as inactive
3. **Tool Invocation** - No code path from agent chat ‚Üí MCP tool calls ‚Üí ServiceNow

## The Gap
The `agent_manager.chat_with_agent()` method only uses OpenAI for responses. It doesn't:
- Check for active MCP couplings
- Invoke MCP tools when needed
- Parse tool responses and include them in the chat

## What Should Happen
When you ask the SRE agent "Show me open incidents", it should:
1. Recognize this requires ServiceNow data
2. Check for active ServiceNow coupling
3. Call the MCP tool `search_incidents`
4. Get real data from ServiceNow
5. Format and return the response

## Current Reality
The agent just uses GPT-4o to generate a response without any real ServiceNow data.

## Solution Needed
Enhance `agent_manager.py` to:
1. Check for active couplings when processing messages
2. Detect when MCP tools are needed
3. Invoke MCP tools through the coupling
4. Include tool results in the agent's response

Without this enhancement, the agent can talk about ServiceNow but can't actually access it.
